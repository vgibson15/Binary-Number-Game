Program behavior

This is a game that pits the user against the computer.  The program plays 10 rounds. During one round, the computer displays a random number between 1 and 100, either as a base-10 value or a base-2 value (chosen randomly). The user must enter the same value in the other base. In otherwords if the computer displays a number in base-10, the user enters base-2; if the computer displays a base-2 number, the user enters base-10. If the user input is correct, she earns 1 point.

Once the 10 rounds are completed, if the user scored 5 or higher, she wins.
